abstract = {In this study 500 hPa geopotential heights from the NCAR-NCEP Reanalysis are used to calculate an index describing the spatial and temporal characteristics of zonal wave three (ZW3) in the high latitude Southern Hemisphere atmosphere. The index spans the period 1958 – 2001. Wavelet analysis of the index shows the strong interannual variation which is characteristic of ZW3 and also reveals significant, high amplitude decadal-scale variation. This interannual variation takes the form of marked fluctuation in sign and magnitude of the index. It appears to occur when there are rapid changes from strongly meridional to strongly zonal flow or vice versa. Initial indications are that some of this variability may be associated with ENSO events.},

abstract = {Characteristics of quasi-stationary (QS) waves in the Southern Hemisphere are discussed using 49 years (1950-1998) of NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. A comparison between the stationary wave amplitudes and phases between the recent data (1979-1998) and the entire 49 years data showed that the differences are not large and the 49 years data can be used for the study. Using the 49 years of data it is found that the amplitude of QS wave 1 has two maxima in the upper atmosphere, one at 30degrees S and the other at 55degrees S. QS waves 2 and 3 have much less amplitude. Monthly variation of the amplitude of QS wave 1 shows that it is highest in October, particularly in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. To examine the QS wave propagation Plumb's methodology is used. A comparison of Eliassen-Palm fluxes for El Ni (n) over tildeo and La Ni (n) over tildea events showed that during El Ni (n) over tildeo events there is a stronger upward and equatorward propagation of QS waves, particularly in the austral spring. Higher upward propagation indicates higher energy transport. A clear wave train can be identified at 300 hPa in all the seasons except in summer. The horizontal component of wave activity flux in the El Ni (n) over tildeo composite seems to be a Rossby wave propagating along a Rossby wave guide, at first poleward until it reaches its turning latitude in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, then equatorward in the vicinity of South America. The position of the center of positive anomalies in the austral spring in the El Ni (n) over tildeo years over the southeast Pacific, near South America, favors the occurrence of blocking highs in this region. This agrees with a recent numerical study by Renwick and Revell (1999).},

abstract = {In many atmospheric diffusion problems, a description of the steadiness of the wind direction is desired. For intervals of approximately an hour the mean wind direction is usually well defined and constant, but for longer intervals this may not be so, and a description of the variability of the mean direction with time is needed. It is proposed that the constancy of the wind, defined as the mean vector wind divided by the mean scalar wind ￼/￼, can be used for simple classification purposes. A value of unity designates that the wind direction has not changed over the averaging period and a value of zero suggests a completely symmetrical distribution. In this paper, a trigonometric transformation is used to linearize the variation of constancy with the mean angular range of direction. This function, called the “steadiness” S, is then computed for various time intervals, and by use of extreme-value theory the recurrence interval of various mean wind direction ranges can be predicted. This provides an important probability statement for air pollution evaluations. Five years of data at Brookhaven National Laboratory have been analyzed for the following hourly intervals; 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384 and 720. The recurrence intervals of S with their associated meteorological conditions are presented for these periods and compared with similar studies of data from other stations.},

@article{Irving2015,
abstract = {AbstractSouthern Hemisphere mid- to upper-tropospheric planetary wave activity is characterized by the superposition of two zonally oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms: zonal wavenumber 1 (ZW1) and zonal wavenumber 3 (ZW3). Previous studies have tended to consider these waveforms in isolation and with the exception of those studies relating to sea ice, little is known about their impact on regional climate variability. A novel approach is taken to quantifying the combined influence of ZW1 and ZW3, using the strength of the hemispheric meridional flow as a proxy for zonal wave activity. The methodology adapts the wave envelope construct routinely used in the identification of synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets and improves on existing approaches by allowing for variations in both wave phase and amplitude. While ZW1 and ZW3 are both prominent features of the climatological circulation, the defining feature of highly meridional hemispheric states is an enhancement of the ZW3 component.

abstract = {Abstract The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted “reanalysis”) to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957–96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided b...},
