\section{Introduction}

Zonal waves, also called planetary waves, that can develop in the
extratropical latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (SH), have received
some attention by the scientific community because of its role in
modulating weather systems and regional climate (xxREF). They are
typically characterized by applying Fourier decomposition to hemispheric
anomalies of sea-level pressure or geopotential heights. On the other
hand, ``stationary waves'' or ``quasi-stationary waves'' are terms
generally reserved in the literature to the zonal asymmetries of the
time mean field (\(\overline{\phi}^*\)). These terms are sometimes used
interchangeably in the SH circulation related studies
\citep[e.g.][]{Rao2004, Raphael2004, Kravchenko2012, Irving2015, Turner2017, Lastovicka2018}.
This leads to both inter and intra-studies inconsistencies.

As examples of the former, \citet{Quintanar1995a} define
``quasi-stationary waves (QS)'' as the zonally asymmetric component of
the climatological mean field. \citet{Raphael2004}, conversely, use the
term ``zonal wave (ZW)'' when describing her index of planetary waves
with wavenumber 3 in phase with the climatological mean wave 3.
\citet{Irving2015} compare \citet{Raphael2004}'s QS index with their own
index computed as the integrated southern hemisphere zonal ``waviness''
irrespective of phase.

As for intra-studies inconsistencies, \citet{Rao2004} follow the
nomenclature of \citet{Quintanar1995a} for QS, but they analyze the mean
amplitude of ZW instead of the amplitude of QS. \citet{Kravchenko2012}
analyze temperature ZW amplitude as a predictor of total ozone, but call
it ``quasi-stationary amplitude''. \citet{Turner2017} use ``planetary
wave k'', ``quasi-stationary wave k'' and ``wave number k'' as
synonymous in their analysis of QS associated with different wavenumbers
k. Furthermore, \citet{Lastovicka2018} study QS and ZW but they use the
term ``stationary planetary wave (SPW)'' to refer to both.

As the name suggests, it is recognized that QS are not completely
stationary. They are the result of the superposition of many individual
ZW, hence there can be variability of their individual phases. However,
there are not recent studies assessing how ``stationary'' or
``quasi-stationary'' ZW are in the SH.

In this study we show that the degree of stationarity of
quasi-stationary waves is related to the distinction between QS and ZW.
We propose using the ratio between the amplitude of QS and the mean
amplitude of ZW as a measure of QS stationarity. By this measure, we
show that planetary waves with wavenumbers 2 and 3 are significantly
less stationary in the southern hemisphere than in the northern
hemisphere.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data}

We will use monthly geopotential fields from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis
\citep{Kalnay1996} for the period 1980 to 2017.

\subsection{Zonal waves and quasi-stationary waves}

In this study we define \emph{planetary waves} as waves that extend
along a full latitude circle. Planetary waves of the ``instantaneous''
fields are called in this study, \emph{zonal waves} (ZW), and the ones
of the field mean will be called \emph{quasi-stationary waves} (QS).
They are characterized by their wavenumber, amplitude and phase such
that

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:ZW}
\mathrm{ZWk}(t) & = & A_\mathrm{ZWk}(t)\cos \left [ k\lambda - \alpha_\mathrm{ZWk}(t) \right ] \\ 
\overline{\mathrm{ZWk}(t)} = \mathrm{QSk} & = & A_\mathrm{QSk}\cos \left (  \mathrm{k}\lambda - \alpha_\mathrm{QSk} \right ) \label{eq:QS}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{linenomath*}

where \(\mathrm{k}\) is the wavenumber, \(\lambda\) the longitude, and
\(\mathrm{A_{x}}\) and \(\alpha_\mathrm{x}\), the amplitude and phase of
each wave, respectively. Note that \(\mathrm{ZWk}(t)\) is, by
construction, explicitly dependent on time, while \(\mathrm{QSk}\) is
not. Furthermore, from the properties of wave superposition it can be
seen that, in general, \(\alpha_\mathrm{QSk}\) does not equal
\(\overline{\alpha_\mathrm{ZWk}}\) an that \(A_\mathrm{QSk}\) will
always be less or equal than \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZWk}}\)
\citep{Pain2005}.

While these definitions depend on which are the ``instantaneous field''
in question (monthly, daily, sub daily, etc\ldots{}) and the averaging
time scale, they illustrate that ZW are properties of the
\emph{elements} of the set, while QS are properties of the set as a
whole. This is an important distinction with theoretical and
methodological implications that is not always differentiated in the
literature.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Amplitude}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Seasonal cycle of amplitude of the geopotential planetary waves 1 to 3 computed as the amplitude of the mean wave ($A_\mathrm{QSk}$) and as the mean amplitude of the monthly waves ($\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW} }$).}\label{fig:rao}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rao} shows the seasonal cycle of the amplitude of
planetary waves at 60\degree S and 60\degree N using monthly fields from
the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis \citep{Kalnay1996} between 1980 and 2017. The
left column (\(A_\mathrm{QS}\)) is computed by taking the amplitude of
the averaged geopotential field for each month, level and wavenumber.
The right column (\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}\)) is computed by taking
the average amplitude of the 49 individual ZW.

Figure \ref{fig:rao1} (60\degree S) shows that for planetary wave 1,
\(A_\mathrm{QS1}\) and \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW1}}\) have similar
vertical structures, seasonal cycles and even magnitude. On the other
hand, \(A_\mathrm{QS2}\) is much smaller than
\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW2}}\) and its seasonal cycle is much less
defined. \(A_\mathrm{QS3}\) has a smaller magnitude than
\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW3}}\) but they have an overall similar structure
of one relative maximum in February-March in the middle troposphere and
another in July-August that extends to the lower stratosphere. But the
details are different, particularly there is a local \(A_\mathrm{QS3}\)
minimum in November that is not present in
\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW3}}\). The relative individual contribution of
each wavenumber is also different. \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW2}}\) is of
higher magnitude than \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW3}}\) in the stratosphere
and of similar magnitude in the troposphere. Conversely,
\(A_\mathrm{QS2}\) is much smaller than \(A_\mathrm{QS3}\) throughout
the year and in almost every level with the exception of the
aforementioned November minimum.

In contrast to Figure \ref{fig:rao1}, Figure \ref{fig:rao2} shows that
at 60\degree N \(A_\mathrm{QS}\) and \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}\) are
very similar for the three wavenumbers. In all cases they have a similar
seasonal cycle with similar vertical extent. This shows that the
difference between \(A_\mathrm{QS}\) and \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}\)
are location-dependent.

\subsection{Stationarity Index}

\citet{Loon1972} recognized the distinction between
\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}\) and \(A_\mathrm{QS}\) and, deduced that
``the daily phases of waves 2 and 4-6 at 50\degree S must therefore be
random since the waves almost cancel themselves when added, whereas 1
and 3 must recur consistently in certain longitudes since they are
significantly large in the climatological mean''. This observation
motivates that stationary conditions in the circulation of the SH could
be measured using the quotient between the two quantities. As an analogy
with the constancy of the wind \citep{Singer1967}, the stationarity of
the QS can be estimated as

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:S}
\hat{S} = \frac{A_\mathrm{QS}}{\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

It can be shown that \(\hat{S} = 1\) for completely stationary waves. On
the other hand, it can be demonstrated that the expected amplitude of
the sum of \(n\) waves with random phases and mean amplitude \(A\) is
\(An^{-1/2}\) \citep{Pain2005}. Thus, for completely non stationary
waves, the expected value of \(\hat{S}\) is \(n^{-1/2}\).

\(\hat{S}\) can equivalently be mathematically defined as

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:S2}
\hat{S} =   \frac{\sum_t A_\mathrm{ZW}(t) \cos  \left [\alpha_\mathrm{zw}(t) - \alpha_{qs} \right ]}{\sum_t A_\mathrm{ZW}(t)}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The numerator is the sum of the projections of each \(\mathrm{ZW}\) onto
the direction of the \(\mathrm{QS}\). Equation \ref{eq:S2} has some
advantages over Equation \ref{eq:S}. First, it makes is clear that
stationarity is a mixture of a phase effect and an amplitude effect.
Secondly, one can, in principle, replace \(\alpha_{qs}\) with any
direction of interest, allowing to evaluate \(\hat{S}(\alpha)\). This
can also be useful for removing variability due to the seasonal cycle.
The position of the monthly QS3 has a shift of about 15\degree between
January and July \citep{Loon1972}, so by replacing \(\alpha_{qs}\) with
\(\alpha_{qs}(month)\) (one for each month) one can evaluate
stationarity with respect to the seasonal changing position of the mean
wave. Finally, it is possible to transform the sums into running sums
with window \(w\) and obtain \(\hat{S}(w, t)\) and analyse variations of
stationarity with time.

While \(\hat{S}\) is used --sometimes as
\(2/\pi\arcsin \left (\hat{S} \right )\) \citep{Singer1967}-- in the
meteorological literature in the context of wind steadiness, to our
knowledge this is the first time it has been applied to the study of
atmospheric waves. However, its statistical properties are not well
studied. One problem with \(\hat{S}\) is that, as seen above, its
estimation from a finite sample has a positive bias, but its convergence
properties are not explored.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:stationarity} shows \(\hat{S}\) for QS 1 to 3 computed
using Equation \ref{eq:S} at 60\degree S and 60\degree N. \ldots{}..

\subsection{Considerations about phase}

\label{sec:phase}

For defining local impacts, the phase of planetary waves is as important
as their amplitude if not more. One way of dealing with the phase of ZW
is to fix it. \citet{Yuan2008} use Principal Component Analysis on the
meridional wind field to obtain a spatial pattern of the leading mode
that is very similar to the QS3. The timeseries associated to this mode
is, then, an indication of the intensity of the ZW3 that is similar to
the QS3. A more direct approach is the index created by
\citet{Raphael2004}. Since it is based on the geopotential height
anomalies at the maximums of the QS3, it is sensitive to ZW3 patterns
with phase close to the stationary phase. An almost mathematically
equivalent approach (with correlation = 0.98) is to compute the
projection of each \(\mathrm{ZW}\) onto the direction of the
\(\mathrm{QS}\) (i.e.~the expression inside the sum of the numerator in
Equation \ref{eq:S2}). This methodology has fewer constrains in that the
phase of interest can be changed depending on the application.

\section{Conclusions}

The fact that zonal waves (ZW) and quasi-stationary waves (QS) are two
distinct but related phenomena has both practical and theoretical
implications.

First, researchers should be aware of which phenomena they want to study
and use the appropriate methods. The mean amplitude of the ZW could be
appropriate to study the vertical propagation of Rossby waves, for
example. But ZW amplitude could lead to misleading results if used as
the basis of local impacts studies because they are probably more
influenced by phase effects.

Secondly, comparison between results should also be made having this
issues in mind. For instance, \citet{Irving2015} compare their planetary
wave activity index with \citet{Raphael2004}'s wave 3 index and conclude
that the later cannot account for events with waves far removed from
their climatological position. However, in light of the discussion in
Section \ref{sec:phase}, this limitation becomes a feature, not a bug.

Although having a consistent nomenclature across papers is desirable, we
believe that this problems can be ameliorated by researchers detailing
their definitions and methodology. This is also good for clarity and
reproducibility. Since planetary waves are generally more stationary in
the northern hemisphere, these issues are more critical for studies of
the southern hemisphere.

Thirdly, the explorations of both ZW and QS can lead to novel levels of
analysis. Here, we showed it can be used to define a metric of
stationarity of quasi-stationary waves, but other applications are also
possible. \citet{Smith2012} used the phase relationship between ZW1 and
QS1 to show that linear interference between the QS1 and ZW1 was related
to vertical wave activity transport at the tropopause.
