In the meteorological literature the analysis of the zonally asymmetric
it is very common to analyse
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Many atmospheric variables have a strong dependence with latitude, so it
is often natural to decompose them into a zonal mean component and a
deviation from it. If \(\phi\) is a generic variable, then

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Z}
\phi_{(x, y, z, t)} = [\phi]_{(y, z, t)} + \phi_{(x, y, z, t)}^*
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where \([\phi]\) is the mean zonal field and \(\phi^*\), the deviations
from it. This zonally asymmetric part is sometimes called ``zonal wave''
or ``planteary wave''. The names ``stationary wave'' or
``quasi-strationary wave'', on the other hand, are generaly reserved to
the zonal asymmetires of the time mean field (\(\overline{\phi}^*\)).
However, these terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the
literature
\citep[e.g.][]{Rao2004, Raphael2004, Kravchenko2012, Irving2015, Turner2017, Lastovicka2018}
which could lead to some confusion.

Given a set of atmospheric fields, we define \emph{zonal waves} (ZW) as
waves observed in each individual ``instantaneous'' field and
\emph{quasi-stationary waves} (QS) as the resulting waves in the mean
field. While these definitions depend on which are the ``instantaneous
field'' in question (monthly, daily, subdaily, etc\ldots{}) and the
averaging timescales used, they illustrate that ZWs are properties of
the \emph{elements} of the set, while the QSs are properties of the set
as a whole. This is an important distinction with theoretical and
methodological implications that is not always appreciated in the
literature.

\section{Story}

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{fig/QS-ZW/rao-1} 

}

\caption{Seasonal cycle of amplitude of the geopotential planetary waves 1 to 3 at 60\degree S computed as the mean amplitude of the monthly waves ($\overline{ZW}$) and as the amplitude of the mean wave (QS). The period of analysis is 1950 to 1998. The left column reproduces Figure 3 from @Rao2004.}\label{fig:rao}
\end{figure}

To illustrate the distinction between ZWs and QS, Figure \ref{fig:rao}
shows the monthly seasonal cycle of amplitude of planetary waves at
60\degree S using monthly fields from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis
\citep{Kalnay1996} between 1950 and 1998. The left column
(\(\overline{ZW}\)) reproduces Figure 3 from \citet{Rao2004} and is
computed by taking --for each month and level-- the average amplitude of
the 49 individual amplitudes. The right column (QS), on the other hand,
is computed by taking the amplitude of the average geopotential field
for each month and level.

The resulting fields convey different information. First, the amplitude
of \(\overline{ZW}\) fields is always greater than the one for QS
fields. This is a mathematical necessity (\emph{xx¿Deberia demostrar
eso? Vale la pena una demostracion en un material suplementario?xx})
that explains \citet{Rao2004}'s observation that their Wave 1 amplitude
was greater than that reported by \citet{Hurrell1998}. Secondly, they
have different annual cycles and vertical structures. QS2 has a strong
minimum in the low stratosphere during the austral autumn that is not
apparent in \(\overline{ZW2}\). Similarly, the austral winter
mid-tropospheric maximum is very well defined in \(\overline{ZW3}\) but
not so in QS3. Thirdly, the relative importance between each wave number
vary. \(\overline{ZW}\) fields show a preponderance of wave 2 over 3 in
almost every level and month. However, the QS3 has greater amplitude
than QS2 in the first half of the year. In contrast with wave-numbers 2
and 3, \(\overline{ZW1}\) and QS1 fields are very similar.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{fig/QS-ZW/hurrell-1} 

}

\caption{Seasonal cycle of amplitude of the geopotential planetary waves 2 at 300hPa computed as the mean amplitude of the monthly waves ($\overline{ZW}$) and as the amplitude of the mean wave (QS). From monthly NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, 1979 to 2017.}\label{fig:hurrell}
\end{figure}

These differences are related to the degree of stationarity of zonal
waves and are location-dependent. Figure \ref{fig:hurrell} show the same
variable that Figure \ref{fig:rao} but for 300hPa. The contrast between
the northern and southern hemisphere is not only evident in the
amplitude of the planetary waves, but also in the comparison between
\(\overline{ZW}\) and QS. Specially for wave-numbers 2 and 3,
\(\overline{ZW}\) and QS fields are very similar in the north but they
have significant differences in the south.

\subsection{Stationarity}

Another important consequence of the distinction between
\(\overline{ZW}\) and QS is that the quotient between the two can be
used as a measure of stationarity. As an analogy with the constancy of
the wind \citep{Singer1967}, planetary wave stationarity can be
estimated as

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:S}
\hat{\mathrm{S}} = \frac{\mathrm{QS}}{\overline{\mathrm{ZW}}}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

It can be shown that \(\hat{\mathrm{S}} = 1\) for completely stationary
waves and that \(E(\hat{\mathrm{S}}) = n^{-1/2}\) for completely
non-stationary waves (where \(n\) is the sample size).

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{fig/QS-ZW/stationarity-1} 

}

\caption{Seasonal cycle of stationarity of the 300hPa geopotential QS2 computed using Equation \ref{eq:S} (shaded) and $\overline{ZW2}$ (contours). From monthly NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, 1979 to 2017.}\label{fig:stationarity}
\end{figure}

As an example, Figure \ref{fig:stationarity} shows \(\hat{\mathrm{S}}\)
for QS2 computed using Equation \ref{eq:S}. The southern hemisphere
clearly shows a lower degree of QS2 stationarity than the northern
hemisphere or the tropics. In the northern mid latitudes there is a
seasonal cycle of stationarity that follows the seasonal cycle of
\(\overline{ZW}\) (Figure \ref{fig:hurrell}). In the southern
hemisphere, instead, the June maximum of \(\overline{ZW}\) at
60\degree S coincides with a minimum of stationarity.

\(\hat{\mathrm{S}}\) can equivalently be defined as the amplitude
weighted mean correlation between each wave phase and the stationary
phase (\emph{xx de nuevo, esto podría demostrarse en un material
suplementario xx}). This definition allows one to construct a time
series of \(\hat{\mathrm{S}}(t)\) by computing a running (weigthed)
mean.

While \(\hat{\mathrm{S}}\) is used --sometimes as
\(2/\pi\arcsin \left (\hat{\mathrm{S}} \right )\) transformation
\citep{Singer1967}-- in the meteorological literature in the context of
wind steadiness, to our knowledge this is the first time it has been
applied to the study of atmospheric waves. Furthermore, its statistical
properties are not well studied. One problem with \(\hat{\mathrm{S}}\),
is that its estimation from a finite sample has a positive bias that is
inversely proportional to the population stationarity, but its
convergence properties are not explored.

\subsection{QS activity}

Defining quasi-stationary waves as a climatological property of a set of
atmospheric fields, precludes, in principle, the possibility of
quantifying a QS metric that applies to instantaneous fields. It would
seem impossible to, for example, construct an time series of QS activity
that could be use as a basis for correlations with other variables,
compositions or for use in other methodologies. But there are ways of
solving this issue.

One possibility is recognising that individual fields can be
characterised by their degree of similarity with the climatological QS.
The index produced by \citet{Raphael2004} for the QS3 is an example.
While not expressly a measure of similarity, it is sensitive to wave 3
patterns with phase close to the stationary phase. \citet{Yuan2008} use
Principal Component Analysis on the meridional wind field; the spatial
pattern of the leading mode is very similar to the QS3 and so a time
series can be obtained by projecting each instantaneous field to it.

Another way of constructing a time series is to exploit the fact the
timescale dependence of QS. By applying a running mean with a suitable
window before computing wave amplitudes, one obtains the QS wave
amplitude of that window. This is the methodology applied by
\citet{Wolf2018} who performed a 15 day low pass filter before computing
wave envelopes. Each data time represented, then, the mean field of the
set of fields covered the 15 day window an thus waves computed from it
are actually QS waves for each of those sets. (\emph{xx no estoy seguro
que se entienda bien xx})

\section{Conclusions}

The fact that zonal waves (ZW) and quasi-stationary waves (QS) are two
distinct but related phenomena has both practical and theoretical
implications.

Firts, researchers should be aware of which phenomena they want to study
and use the appropriate methods. The mean amplitude of the ZW could be
appropireate to study the vertical propagation of Rossby waves, for
example. But ZW amplitude could lead to misleading results if used as
the basis of local impacts studies because they are probably more
influenced by phase effects. For clarity and reproducibility, we
encourage researchers in the field to describe if they are using the
mean amplitude of the individual waves or the amplitude of the mean
wave.

Secondly, comparison between results should also be made having this
issues in mind. For instance, \citet{Irving2015} compare their planetary
wave activity index with \citet{Raphael2004}'s wave 3 index and conclude
that the later cannot account for events with waves far removed from
their climatological position. However, by understanding it as an index
of QS3 similitude, this limitation becomes a feature, not a bug.

Since planetary waves are generally more stationary in the northern
hemisphere, these issues are more critical for studies of the southern
hemisphere.

Thirdly, the explorations of both ZW and QS can lead to novel levels of
analysis. Here, we showed it can be used to define a metric of
stationarity of quasi-stationary waves, but other applications are also
possible. \citet{Smith2012} used the phase relationship between ZW1 and
QS1 to show that linear interference between the QS1 and ZW1 was related
to vertical wave activity transport at the tropopause.
