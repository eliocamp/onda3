abstract = {In this paper we will argue that the superposition of waves can be calculated and taught in a simple way. We show, using the Gauss's method to sum an arithmetic sequence, how we can construct the superposition of waves - with different frequencies - in a simple conceptual way that it is easy to teach. By this method we arrive to the usual result where we can express the superposition of waves as the product of factors, one of them with a cosine funtion where the argument is the average frequency. Most important, we will show that the superposition of waves with sligthly different frequencies produces a $\backslash$emph{\{}phase modulation{\}} thogether with an amplitude moldulation. It is important to emphasize this result because, to the best of our knowledge, almost all textbooks only mention that there is an amplitude modulation.},

abstract = {In many atmospheric diffusion problems, a description of the steadiness of the wind direction is desired. For intervals of approximately an hour the mean wind direction is usually well defined and constant, but for longer intervals this may not be so, and a description of the variability of the mean direction with time is needed. It is proposed that the constancy of the wind, defined as the mean vector wind divided by the mean scalar wind ￼/￼, can be used for simple classification purposes. A value of unity designates that the wind direction has not changed over the averaging period and a value of zero suggests a completely symmetrical distribution. In this paper, a trigonometric transformation is used to linearize the variation of constancy with the mean angular range of direction. This function, called the “steadiness” S, is then computed for various time intervals, and by use of extreme-value theory the recurrence interval of various mean wind direction ranges can be predicted. This provides an important probability statement for air pollution evaluations. Five years of data at Brookhaven National Laboratory have been analyzed for the following hourly intervals; 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384 and 720. The recurrence intervals of S with their associated meteorological conditions are presented for these periods and compared with similar studies of data from other stations.},

abstract = {Natural variability is an essential component of observations of all geophysical and climate variables. In principal component analysis (PCA), also called empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, a set of orthogonal eigenfunctions is found from a spatial covariance function. These empirical basis functions often lend useful insights into physical processes in the data and serve as a useful tool for developing statistical methods. The underlying assumption in PCA is the stationarity of the data analyzed; that is, the covariance function does not depend on the origin of time. The stationarity assumption is often not justifiable for geophysical and climate variables even after removing such cyclic components as the diurnal cycle or the annual cycle. As a result, physical and statistical inferences based on EOFs can be misleading. Some geophysical and climatic variables exhibit periodically time-dependent covariance statistics. Such a dataset is said to be periodically correlated or cyclostationary. A proper recognition of the time-dependent response characteristics is vital in accurately extracting physically meaningful modes and their space-time evolutions from data. This also has important implications in finding physically consistent evolutions and teleconnection patterns and in spectral analysis of variability-important goals in many climate and geophysical studies. In this study, the conceptual foundation of cyclostationary EOF (CSEOF) analysis is examined as an alternative to regular EOF analysis or other eigenanalysis techniques based on the stationarity assumption. Comparative examples and illustrations are given to elucidate the conceptual difference between the CSEOF technique and other techniques and the entailing ramification in physical and statistical inferences based on computational eigenfunctions.},

abstract = {Predictability of the southern annular mode (SAM) for lead times beyond 1–2 weeks has traditionally been considered to be low because the SAM is regarded as an internal mode of variability with a typical decor- relation time of about 10 days. However, the association of the SAM with El Ni{\~{}} no–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) suggests the potential for making seasonal predictions of the SAM. In this study the authors explore seasonal predictability and the predictive skill of SAM using observations and retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology dynamical seasonal forecast system [the Predictive Ocean and Atmosphere Model for Australia, version 2 (POAMA2)]. Based on the observed seasonal relationships of the SAM with tropical sea surface temperatures, two distinctive periods of high seasonal predictability are suggested: austral late autumn to winter and late spring to early summer. Predictability of theSAMin the austral cold seasons stems from the association of theSAM with warm-pool (or Modoki/central Pacific) ENSO, whereas predictability in the austral warm seasons stems from the association of the SAM with cold-tongue (or eastern Pacific) ENSO. Using seasonal hindcasts for 1980–2010 fromPOAMA2,it is shown that the observed relationship between SAM and ENSO is faithfully depicted and SST variations associated with ENSO are skillfully predicted. Consequently,POAMA2 can skillfully predict the phase and amplitude of seasonal anomalies of theSAMin early summer and early winter for at least one season in advance. Zero-lead monthly forecasts of theSAMare furthermore shown to be highly skillful in almost all months, which is ascribed to predictability stemming from observed atmospheric initial conditions. 1.},

abstract = {Topographic meandering of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is found to be an impediment in the propagation of Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW) in the Indian Ocean sector of Antarctica. Reasons for this are attributed to the southward advection of the ACW anomalies associated with the topographic meandering of the ACC. The southward meandering of ACC facilitates warming up of the region east of 20°E by about 1°C during winter, thereby reducing the sea ice; these processes interfere with the eastward propagating positive sea‐ice anomalies, and reduce its strength. Warming of ocean induced by topographic meandering leads to upward vertical velocities between 40°–60°E, where the ocean surface velocities are weak and southward, and the vertical/meridional advection of temperature dominates the zonal advection in the atmosphere. This results in the decoupling of the ACW in the region east of 40°E. In regions out side the Indian Ocean sector, vertical advection is minimum and zonal velocity of ACC becomes positive, which facilitates the ACW propagation in the Central Pacific, Ross and Weddell Seas.},

abstract = {Persistent anomalies with recurrent spatial patterns play an important role in the atmosphere's low-frequency variability. A connection between statistical and dynamical methods of description and prediction of persistent anomalies is established by computing and analyzing the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) in a simple deterministic model, on the one hand, and in Southern Hemisphere geopotential heights, on the other. The dynamical model is governed by the fully nonlinear, equivalent-barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere, with simplified forcing, dissipation and topography. The Southern Hemisphere data consist in gridded daily maps of 500 mb heights from June 1972 to July 1983. Two types of persistent anomalies appear in this time series, both having a strong wavenumber-three component; they differ by the value of the constant phase of this wave and by the strength of the wavenumber-one component. The first two EOFs bear a striking resemblance to these two patterns. It is concluded that the dynamical interpretation of EOFs is their pointing from the time mean to the most populated regions of the system's phase space. Pursuing this interpretation, a Markov-chain formulation of transitions from one persistent anomaly regime to another is introduced, and the implications for long-range forecasting are discussed.},

abstract = {Interannual variability in the Southern Ocean is investigated via nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis (NLSA), an objective eigendecomposition technique for nonlinear dynamical systems that can simultaneously recover multiple timescales from data with high skill. Applied to modeled and observed sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration data, NLSA recovers the wavenumber-2 eastward propagating signal corresponding to the Antarctic circumpolar wave (ACW). During certain phases of its lifecycle, the spatial patterns of this mode display a structure that can explain the statistical origin of the Antarctic dipole pattern. Another group of modes have combination frequencies consistent with the modulation of the annual cycle by the ACW. Further examination of these newly identified modes reveals that they can have either eastward or westward propagation, combined with meridional pulsation reminiscent of sea ice reemergence patterns in the Arctic. Moreover, they exhibit smaller-scale spatial structures, and explain more Indian Ocean variance than the primary ACW modes. We attribute these modes to teleconnections between ACW and the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean; in particular, fundamental ENSO modes and their associated combination modes with the annual cycle recovered by NLSA. Another mode extracted from the Antarctic variables displays an eastward propagating wavenumber-3 structure over the Southern Ocean, but exhibits no strong correlation to interannual Indo-Pacific variability.},

The ACW is characterized by a$\backslash$npersistent phase relationship between warm (cool) sea surface$\backslash$ntemperature (SST) anomalies and poleward (equatorward) meridional$\backslash$nsurface wind (MSW) anomalies. Recently, White and Chen demonstrated that$\backslash$nSST anomalies in the Southern Ocean operate to induce anomalous vortex$\backslash$nstretching in the lower troposphere that is balanced by the anomalous$\backslash$nmeridional advection of planetary vorticity, yielding MSW anomalies as$\backslash$nobserved. In the present study, the authors seek to understand how this$\backslash$natmospheric response to SST anomalies produces a positive feedback to$\backslash$nthe ocean (i.e., an anomalous SST tendency displaced eastward of SST$\backslash$nanomalies) that both maintains the ACW against dissipation and accounts$\backslash$nfor its eastward propagation. To achieve this, we couple a global$\backslash$nequilibrium climate model for the lower troposphere to a global heat$\backslash$nbudget model for the upper ocean. In the absence of coupling, the model$\backslash$nAntarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) advects SST anomalies from initial$\backslash$nconditions to the east at speeds slower than observed, taking 12-14$\backslash$nyears to circle the globe with amplitudes that become insignificant$\backslash$nafter 6-8 years. In the presence of coupling, eastward speeds of the$\backslash$nmodel ACC are matched by those due to coupling, together yielding a$\backslash$nmodel ACW of a nominal 4-yr period composed of two waves that circle the$\backslash$nglobe in approximately 8 years, as observed. Feedback from atmosphere to$\backslash$nocean works through the anomalous zonal surface wind response to SST$\backslash$nanomalies, yielding poleward Ekman how anomalies in phase with warm SST$\backslash$nanomalies. As such, maintenance of the model ACW is achieved through a$\backslash$nbalance between anomalous meridional Ekman heat advection and anomalous$\backslash$nsensible-plus-latent heat loss to the atmosphere. This balance requires$\backslash$nthe alignment of covarying SST and MSW anomalies to be tilted into the$\backslash$nsouthwest-northeast direction, which accounts for the spiral structure$\backslash$nobserved in global SST and sea level pressure anomaly patterns around$\backslash$nthe Southern Ocean. Eastward coupling speeds of the model ACW derive$\backslash$nfrom a beta effect in coupling that displaces a portion of the anomalous$\backslash$nmeridional Ekman heat advection, and its corresponding anomalous SST$\backslash$ntendency, to the east of SST anomalies. Therefore, the ACW is an example$\backslash$nof self-organization within the global ocean-atmosphere system,$\backslash$ndepending upon the spherical shape of the rotating earth for its$\backslash$npropagation and the mean meridional SST gradient for its maintenance,$\backslash$nand producing a net poleward eddy heat flux in the upper ocean that$\backslash$ntends to reduce this mean gradient.},

abstract = {The Southern Ocean (SO) is the region of the World Ocean bordering on Antarctica over which significant exchanges between the atmosphere, the ocean, and the sea ice take place. Here, the strong and nearly unhindered eastward flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current plays an important role in mean global climate as it transmits climate anomalies around the hemisphere. Features of interannual variability have been observed to propagate eastward around the SO with the circumpolar flow in the form of a system of coupled anomalies, known as the Antarctic circumpolar wave (ACW). In the present study, the 142-yr series of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis, version 2, dataset (850-hPa geopotential height, sea level pressure, sea surface temperature, surface meridional wind, and surface air temperature) spanning from 1871 to 2012 is used to investigate the presence and variability of ACWs. This examination shows, for the first time, the presence of the ACW before the mid-1950s and interdecadal changes in its characteristics. Modifications in the strength and speed of the circumpolar wave are shown to be linked with large-scale climate changes. Complex empirical orthogonal function analyses confirm that the ACW becomes apparent when the tropical El Ni{\~{n}}o- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal gives rise to the Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern and is a consequence of the constructive combination of the PSA and the subantarctic zonal wavenumber 3. Correlation analyses are also performed to quantify the role played by ENSO teleconnections for the appearance of the ACW, and the impact on the presence of ACWs of three super-El Ni{\~{n}}o events is investigated. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Meteorological Society.},

Here, we analyse recent atmosphere, surface ocean and sea-ice observations in this region and assess their trends in the context of palaeoclimate records and climate model simulations. Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends.

abstract = {Recent warming of the Antarctic Peninsula during austral autumn, winter, and spring has been linked to sea surface temperature (SST) trends in the tropical Pacific and tropical Atlantic, while warming of the northeast Peninsula during summer has been linked to a strengthening of westerly winds traversing the Peninsula associated with a positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Here we demonstrate that circulation changes associated with the SAM dominate interannual temperature variability across the entire Antarctic Peninsula during both summer and autumn, while relationships with tropical Pacific SST variability associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are strongest and statistically significant primarily during winter and spring only. We find the ENSO-Peninsula temperature relationship during autumn to be weak on interannual time scales and regional circulation anomalies associated with the SAM more important for interannual temperature variability across the Peninsula during autumn. Consistent with previous studies, western Peninsula temperatures during autumn, winter, and spring are closely tied to changes in the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and associated meridional wind anomalies. The interannual variability of ASL depth is most strongly correlated with the SAM index during autumn, while the ENSO relationship is strongest during winter and spring. Investigation of western and northeast Peninsula temperatures separately reveals that interannual variability of northeast Peninsula temperatures is primarily sensitive to zonal wind anomalies crossing the Peninsula and resultant leeside adiabatic warming rather than to meridional wind anomalies, which is closely tied to variability in the zonal portion of the SAM pattern.},

Zonal wave number 3 dominated in the Antarctic, especially so across the west Antarctic. Results showed the coexistence of stationary and propagating wave components. A spectral analysis of the first two principal components (PCs) showed a similar structure for periods up to 15 days but generally more power in PC1 at longer periods. Regression analysis upon atmospheric fields using the first two PCs of sea-ice concentration showed a coherent wave number 3 pattern. The spatial phase delay between the sea-ice and mean sea-level pressure patterns suggests that meridional flow and associated temperature advection are important for modulating the sea-ice field. EOF analyses carried out separately for El Ni{\~{n}}o, La Ni{\~{n}}a and neutral years, and for Southern Annular Mode positive, negative and neutral periods, suggest that the spatial patterns of wave number 3 shift between subsets.

The MCA pattern is characterized by an Antarctic dipole (ADP)-like pattern in SIC and a positively polarized Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) in Z500. Such long lead-time covariance suggests the forcing of the AAO by persistent ADP-like SIC anomalies.

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used as a tool in (exploratory) data investigations for many different research areas such as analytical chemistry, food- and pharmaceutical-research, and multivariate statistical process control. Despite its popularity, not many results have been reported thus far on how to calculate reliable confidence interval limits in PCA estimates. And, like all other data analysis tasks, results of PCA are not complete without reasonable expectations for the parameter uncertainties, especially in the case of predictive model objectives. In this paper we will present a case study on how to calculate confidence limits based on bootstrap re-sampling. Two NIR datasets are used to build bootstrap confidence limits. The first dataset shows the effect of outliers on bootstrap confidence limits, while the second shows the bootstrap confidence limits when the data has a bimodal distribution. The different steps and choices which have to be made for the algorithm to perform correctly will be presented. The bootstrap based confidence limits will be compared with the corresponding asymptotic confidence limits. We will thereby conclude that the confidence limits based on the bootstrap method give more meaningful answers and are to be preferred over its asymptotic counterparts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In recent decades, Antarctica has experienced pronounced climate changes. The Antarctic Peninsula exhibited the strongest warming1, 2 of any region on the planet, causing rapid changes in land ice3, 4. Additionally, in contrast to the sea-ice decline over the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice has not declined, but has instead undergone a perplexing redistribution5, 6. Antarctic climate is influenced by, among other factors, changes in radiative forcing7 and remote Pacific climate variability8, 9, but none explains the observed Antarctic Peninsula warming or the sea-ice redistribution in austral winter. However, in the north and tropical Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation10, 11 (a leading mode of sea surface temperature variability) has been overlooked in this context. Here we show that sea surface warming related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation reduces the surface pressure in the Amundsen Sea and contributes to the observed dipole-like sea-ice redistribution between the Ross and Amundsen–Bellingshausen–Weddell seas and to the Antarctic Peninsula warming. Support for these findings comes from analysis of observational and reanalysis data, and independently from both comprehensive and idealized atmospheric model simulations. We suggest that the north and tropical Atlantic is important for projections of future climate change in Antarctica, and has the potential to affect the global thermohaline circulation6 and sea-level change},

Defining persistent anomalies as those of at least 100 m in magnitude lasting for at least 5 days, it is found that the region of most frequent occurrence is over the South Pacific. A cluster analysis of monthly PPA counts shows two distinct patterns, one a zonal wavenumber-1 (ZW1) pattern centered over the southeast Pacific near 60 degrees S and the other a zonal wavenumber-3 (ZW3) pattern with centers near New Zealand and over the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Results were insensitive to the choice of dataset, and to the removal of a linear trend from the daily height fields. The southeast Pacific PPA region is strongly modulated by ENSO, while the ZW3 pattern appears only weakly related to ENSO variability. A strong upward trend is apparent in occurrence of the ZW3 cluster, related to a matching trend in the variance of the height fields, particularly those from ECMWF. Such trends are at least in part a consequence of changes in the observing system, particularly the introduction of satellite soundings in the late 1970s},

This study further examines the seasonal changes in the SAM structure and explores temperature signals across the Southern Hemisphere that are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure. The SAM asymmetries are most marked in the Pacific sector and in austral winter and spring, related to changes in the jet entrance and exit regions poleward of 30 degrees S. Depending on the season, the asymmetric SAM structure explains over 25{\%} of the variance in the overall SAM structure and has strong connections with ENSO or zonal wavenumber 3. In austral summer and autumn the SAM has been becoming more zonally symmetric, especially after 1980, perhaps tied to changes in anthropogenic forcing. Across the Pacific sector, including the Antarctic Peninsula, temperature variations are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure, while temperatures across East Antarctica are more strongly tied to the zonally symmetric SAM structure. The results suggest that studies examining the climate impacts of the SAM across the Southern Hemisphere need to consider the seasonal variations in the SAM structure as well as varying impacts between its positive and negative polarity to adequately describe the underlying relationships.},

abstract = {Variability in the southern atmospheric circulation at mid- to high$\backslash$nlatitudes with a dominant quasi-stationary wavenumber-3 pattern has been$\backslash$nreported in many observational studies. The variability is barotropic in$\backslash$nnature with signals in the middle troposphere as well as at the$\backslash$natmosphere-ocean interface. Moreover, there are preferred Fixed centers$\backslash$nfor the strongest anomalies. These features are well reproduced by the$\backslash$nCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation coupled$\backslash$nmodel on various timescales. On the interannual timescale. an index of$\backslash$nthe modeled wavenumber-3 pattern shows little correlation with the$\backslash$nmodeled Southern Oscillation index, suggesting that the variability$\backslash$nassociated with wavenumber 3 anomalies is separate to modeled ENSO-like$\backslash$nevents. However, the variation of the pattern index is strikingly$\backslash$nsimilar to, and highly correlated with, the modeled oceanic variability.$\backslash$nThe associated oceanic anomalies move eastward and are similar to those$\backslash$nof the observed Antarctic circumpolar wave (ACW). The modeled ACW-like$\backslash$nanomalies exist not only at the surface but also through middle ocean$\backslash$ndepths, with a similar barotropic nature to those of the atmospheric$\backslash$nanomalies. The oceanic anomalies also display a wavenumber-3 pattern.$\backslash$nThe essential elements of the dynamics of the modeled ACW are the$\backslash$nadvection of SST anomalies by the surface Antarctic Circumpolar Current$\backslash$n(ACC), and the interactions between anomalies of SST and mean sea level$\backslash$npressure (MSLP). Associated with the standing wavenumber-3 pattern,$\backslash$nthere are fixed centers for the strongest MSLP anomalies. As a positive$\backslash$nSST anomaly advected by surface ACC approaches a center of a positive$\backslash$nMSLP anomaly, the MSLP decreases. The positive (negative) SST anomalies$\backslash$nare generated by anomalous latent and heat fluxes, which are in turn$\backslash$ninduced by southward (northward) meridional wind stress anomalies$\backslash$nresulting from geostrophic balance. These MSLP anomalies change sign$\backslash$nwhen the positive (negative) SST anomalies move to a location near the$\backslash$ncenters. Once MSLP anomalies change sign, positive (negative) SST$\backslash$nanomalies are generated again reinforcing the anomalies entering from$\backslash$nthe west. The time for the surface ACC to advect one-sixth of the$\backslash$ncircuit around the pole corresponds to the time of a half-cycle of the$\backslash$nstanding MSLP oscillations. Thus the surface ACC determines the$\backslash$nfrequency of the standing oscillation. In the present model, the speed$\backslash$nof the surface ACC is such that the period of the standing oscillation$\backslash$nis 4-5 yr, and it would take 12-16 yr for an anomaly to encircle the$\backslash$npole. These and other features of the modeled ACW, together with$\backslash$nassociated dynamic processes, are analyzed and discussed.},

abstract = {Predictability of the southern annular mode (SAM) for lead times beyond 1–2 weeks has traditionally been considered to be low because the SAM is regarded as an internal mode of variability with a typical decor- relation time of about 10 days. However, the association of the SAM with El Ni{\{}{\~{}}{\}} no–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) suggests the potential for making seasonal predictions of the SAM. In this study the authors explore seasonal predictability and the predictive skill of SAM using observations and retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology dynamical seasonal forecast system [the Predictive Ocean and Atmosphere Model for Australia, version 2 (POAMA2)]. Based on the observed seasonal relationships of the SAM with tropical sea surface temperatures, two distinctive periods of high seasonal predictability are suggested: austral late autumn to winter and late spring to early summer. Predictability of theSAMin the austral cold seasons stems from the association of theSAM with warm-pool (or Modoki/central Pacific) ENSO, whereas predictability in the austral warm seasons stems from the association of the SAM with cold-tongue (or eastern Pacific) ENSO. Using seasonal hindcasts for 1980–2010 fromPOAMA2,it is shown that the observed relationship between SAM and ENSO is faithfully depicted and SST variations associated with ENSO are skillfully predicted. Consequently,POAMA2 can skillfully predict the phase and amplitude of seasonal anomalies of theSAMin early summer and early winter for at least one season in advance. Zero-lead monthly forecasts of theSAMare furthermore shown to be highly skillful in almost all months, which is ascribed to predictability stemming from observed atmospheric initial conditions. 1.},

@article{OKane2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.We identify the dynamical drivers of systematic changes in persistent quasi-stationary states (regimes) of the Southern Hemisphere troposphere and their secular trends. We apply a purely data-driven approach, whereby a multiscale approximation to nonstationary dynamical processes is achieved through optimal sequences of locally stationary fast vector autoregressive factor processes, to examine a high resolution atmospheric reanalysis over the period encompassing 1958–2013. This approach identifies regimes and their secular trends in terms of the predictability of the flow and is Granger causal. A comprehensive set of diagnostics on both isentropic and isobaric surfaces is employed to examine teleconnections over the full hemisphere and for a set of regional domains. Composite states for the hemisphere obtained from nonstationary nonparametric cluster analysis reveal patterns consistent with a circumglobal wave 3 (polar)–wave 5 (subtropical) pattern, while regional composites reveal the Pacific South American pattern and blocking modes. The respective roles of potential vorticity sources, stationary Rossby waves and baroclinic instability on the dynamics of these circulation modes are shown to be reflected by the seasonal variations of the waveguides, where Rossby wave sources and baroclinic disturbances are largely contained within the waveguides and with little direct evidence of sustained remote tropical influences on persistent synoptic features. Warm surface temperature anomalies are strongly connected with regions of upper level divergence and anticyclonic Rossby wave sources. The persistent states identified reveal significant variability on interannual to decadal time scales with large secular trends identified in all sectors apart from a region close to South America.},

abstract = {AbstractSouthern Hemisphere mid- to upper-tropospheric planetary wave activity is characterized by the superposition of two zonally oriented, quasi-stationary waveforms: zonal wavenumber 1 (ZW1) and zonal wavenumber 3 (ZW3). Previous studies have tended to consider these waveforms in isolation and with the exception of those studies relating to sea ice, little is known about their impact on regional climate variability. A novel approach is taken to quantifying the combined influence of ZW1 and ZW3, using the strength of the hemispheric meridional flow as a proxy for zonal wave activity. The methodology adapts the wave envelope construct routinely used in the identification of synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets and improves on existing approaches by allowing for variations in both wave phase and amplitude. While ZW1 and ZW3 are both prominent features of the climatological circulation, the defining feature of highly meridional hemispheric states is an enhancement of the ZW3 component.
