  abstract = {A distinctive feature of the Southern Hemisphere extratropical atmospheric circulation is the quasi-stationary zonal wave 3 pattern. This pattern is present in both the mean atmospheric circulation and its variability on daily, seasonal and interannual timescales. While the zonal wave 3 pattern has substantial impacts on meridional heat transport and Antarctic sea ice extent, the reason for its existence remains uncertain, although it has long been assumed to be linked to the presence of three major landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model to show that the stationary zonal wave 3 pattern is instead driven by zonally asymmetric deep convection in the tropics, with little influence from extratropical orography or landmasses. Localized regions of deep convection in the tropics form a local Hadley cell, which in turn creates a wave source in the subtropics that excites a poleward- and eastward-propagating wave train, forming quasi-stationary waves in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. Our findings suggest that changes in tropical deep convection, either due to natural variability or climate change, fundamentally control the zonal wave 3 pattern, with implications for southern high-latitude climate, ocean circulation and sea ice.},
