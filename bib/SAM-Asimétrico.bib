  abstract = {Assessing stratosphere\textendash{}troposphere coupling in observational data or model output requires a multi-level index with high time resolution. Ideally, such an index would (1) represent spatial patterns in the troposphere that are most strongly coupled with stratospheric variability and (2) be robust and computationally feasible in both observations and standard model output. Several of the indices used to diagnose extratropical stratosphere\textendash{}troposphere coupling are based on the Northern and Southern Hemisphere annular modes. The annular mode indices are commonly defined as the leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of monthly-mean, hemispheric geopotential height. In the lowermost troposphere, the structure of the annular modes is defined as the leading EOF of the near-surface geopotential height field, and these patterns correspond well to the patterns of variability induced by stratospheric circulation changes. At pressure levels above the surface, the structure of the annular modes is typically found by either calculating the local EOF or regressing geopotential height data onto the leading principal component time series of near-surface geopotential height. Here we make a critical comparison of the existing methodologies used to diagnose stratosphere\textendash{}troposphere coupling, including EOF-based indices as well as measures based on zonal-mean wind at a fixed latitude and geopotential height over the polar cap. We argue in favour of an alternative methodology based on EOFs of daily zonally-averaged geopotential. We find that (1) the daily evolution of stratosphere\textendash{}troposphere coupling events is seen most clearly with this methodology, and (2) the methodology is robust and requires few subjective choices, making it readily applicable to climate model output available only in zonal-mean form.

  abstract = {The annular mode simulated by an atmospheric general circulation model with a zonally symmetric lower boundary is investigated. The annular mode, defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of the zonal-mean surface pressure, has a meridional structure consisting of a north\textendash{}south dipole, similar to observations. The leading EOF of the zonally varying surface pressure has the same meridional structure and is also zonally symmetric. Because the lower boundary is zonally symmetric, composites of days with high projection onto the mode have, to within sampling error, no zonal structure. However, individual periods during which the zonal-mean surface pressure projects strongly onto the annular mode are dominated by zonally localized structures. Thus, the model annular mode represents a zonally homogeneous distribution of zonally localized events with a similar meridional structure, rather than a zonally symmetric mode of variability per se. Individual annular-mode events typically show a north\textendash{}south teleconnection pattern whose meridional structure closely resembles the annular mode and whose zonal structure extends 60\textdegree{} to 90\textdegree{} in longitude, with a slight northwest\textendash{}southeast offset between its centers of action. Similar structures are found for EOFs calculated over a subset of the domain corresponding to the width of the Atlantic basin. The spatial structure of both the teleconnection pattern and the regional EOFs resemble the observed North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern.},

  abstract = {The influence of zonally asymmetric boundary conditions on the leading modes of variability in a suite of atmospheric general circulation models is investigated. The set of experiments consists of nine model configurations, with varying degrees and types of zonal asymmetry in their boundary conditions. The structure of the leading EOF varies with the zonal asymmetry of the base state for each model configuration. In particular, a close relationship is found between the structure of the EOF and the model storm tracks. An approximately linear relationship is found to hold between the magnitude of the zonal asymmetry of the leading EOF and of the storm tracks in the models. It is shown that this linear relationship extends to the observations. One-point correlation maps centered on the regions where the EOFs reach their maximum amplitude show similar structures for all configurations. These structures consist of a north\textendash{}south dipole, resembling the observed structure of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). They are significantly more zonally localized than the leading EOF, but do resemble one-point correlation maps and sector EOFs calculated for a simulation with zonally symmetric boundary conditions. Thus, the leading EOF for each simulation appears to represent the longitudinal distribution of zonally localized NAO-like patterns. This longitudinal distribution appears to be tied to the distribution of high-frequency eddies, as represented by the storm tracks. A detailed momentum budget for each case confirms that high-frequency eddies play a crucial role in producing the NAO-like patterns. Other dynamical processes also play an important role, but vary with the details of the simulation.},

Here we investigate temporal variations in El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\textendash{}related tropical forcing and Southern Annular Mode (SAM)\textendash{}related forcing on the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas Low and the regional climate during austral spring. We find a spatial dependency regarding the impacts each of these climate modes have on the Antarctic Peninsula: relationships with ENSO and Antarctic Peninsula climate are persistent and significant across the western Peninsula, while relationships with the SAM are persistent and significant across the northeastern Peninsula. Other ENSO/SAM\textendash{}Peninsula temperature correlations appear weak since 1957 as they vary temporally, fluctuating in response to changing correlations between the SAM index and the Southern Oscillation Index in austral spring. Changes in the ENSO-SAM correlations are due primarily to the 1988 La Ni{\~n}a/SAM negative event, which significantly altered the location of the ENSO teleconnection in the South Pacific Ocean and, therefore, its influence on the regional climate. Whether or not there is decadal variability in the ENSO-SAM relationship remains unclear; however, it is evident that the influence across the Peninsula varies in both space and time, related to the strength and spatial extent of the response in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. This suggests that in order to accurately attribute the warming to ENSO-related tropical forcing, it is necessary to consider the role of the regional circulation manifested by the phase of each climate mode together.},

  abstract = {Recent warming of the Antarctic Peninsula during austral autumn, winter, and spring has been linked to sea surface temperature (SST) trends in the tropical Pacific and tropical Atlantic, while warming of the northeast Peninsula during summer has been linked to a strengthening of westerly winds traversing the Peninsula associated with a positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Here we demonstrate that circulation changes associated with the SAM dominate interannual temperature variability across the entire Antarctic Peninsula during both summer and autumn, while relationships with tropical Pacific SST variability associated with the El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are strongest and statistically significant primarily during winter and spring only. We find the ENSO-Peninsula temperature relationship during autumn to be weak on interannual time scales and regional circulation anomalies associated with the SAM more important for interannual temperature variability across the Peninsula during autumn. Consistent with previous studies, western Peninsula temperatures during autumn, winter, and spring are closely tied to changes in the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and associated meridional wind anomalies. The interannual variability of ASL depth is most strongly correlated with the SAM index during autumn, while the ENSO relationship is strongest during winter and spring. Investigation of western and northeast Peninsula temperatures separately reveals that interannual variability of northeast Peninsula temperatures is primarily sensitive to zonal wind anomalies crossing the Peninsula and resultant leeside adiabatic warming rather than to meridional wind anomalies, which is closely tied to variability in the zonal portion of the SAM pattern.},

Results show that the Southern Oscillation (SO) is responsible for part of the zonal asymmetry in AAO. The Western Hemisphere and the Eastern Hemisphere parts of AAO are correlated at 0.23 and 0.52 respectively for the period of 1959?1998 before and after the linear regressions on the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) have been removed from the time series. The paper also discusses the relationship between the precipitation in the East Asia and the AAO before and after removing the linear regressions on SO index (SOI), indicating the stable relationship between the East Asian precipitation and the zonal symmetric component of AAO.},

  abstract = {Meridional dipoles of zonal wind and geopotential height are found extensively in empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and single-point correlation maps of observations and models. Notable examples are the North Atlantic Oscillation and the so-called annular modes (or the Arctic Oscillation). Minimal stochastic models are developed to explain the origin of such structure. In particular, highly idealized, analytic, purely stochastic models of the barotropic, zonally averaged zonal wind and of the zonally averaged surface pressure are constructed, and it is found that the meridional dipole pattern is a natural consequence of the conservation of zonal momentum and mass by fluid motions. Extension of the one-dimensional zonal wind model to two-dimensional flow illustrates the manner in which a local meridional dipole structure may become zonally elongated in EOF analysis, producing a zonally uniform EOF even when the dynamics is not particularly zonally coherent on hemispheric length scales. The analytic system then provides a context for understanding the existence of zonally uniform patterns in models where there are no zonally coherent motions. It is also shown how zonally asymmetric dynamics can give rise to structures resembling the North Atlantic Oscillation. Both the one- and two-dimensional results are manifestations of the same principle: given a stochastic system with a simple red spectrum in which correlations between points in space (or time) decay as the separation between them increases, EOF analysis will typically produce the gravest mode allowed by the system's constraints. Thus, grave dipole patterns can be robustly expected to arise in the statistical analysis of a model or observations, regardless of the presence or otherwise of a dynamical mode.},

A series of model calculations are performed to examine why positive (negative) intraseasonal SAM events are observed to occur much more frequently during La Ni{\~n}a (El Ni{\~n}o). Seven different model runs are performed: a control run, three El Ni{\~n}o runs (the first with a zonally symmetric heating field, the second with a zonally asymmetric heating/cooling field, and the third that combines both fields), and three La Ni{\~n}a runs (with heating fields of opposite sign).The model runs with the zonally symmetric and combined heating fields are found to yield the same relationship between the phase of ENSO and the preferred phase for SAM events as is observed in the atmosphere. In contrast, the zonally asymmetric model runs are found to have the opposite SAM\textendash{}ENSO phase preference characteristics. Since a reduced midlatitude meridional potential vorticity gradient has been linked to a greater frequency of positive-phase SAM events, and vice versa for negative SAM events, the meridional potential vorticity gradient in the various model runs was compared. The results suggest that the phase preference of SAM events during ENSO arises from the impact of the zonal-mean heating on the midlatitude meridional potential vorticity gradient.},

When the sphericity of the domain is accounted for, observed and numerically simulated annular modes for the Southern Hemisphere summertime are found to be in excellent agreement. In particular, the annular mode and zonal index mode are shown to be related but distinct. Although the annular mode is strongly (but not identically) related to fluctuations in jet position, fluctuations in jet strength and width are shown to also be important for its simulation. When the sphericity of the domain is neglected, analytic expressions for the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of zonal-mean geopotential for the cases of individual fluctuations in jet strength, position, and width can be obtained. None of these EOF modes have the characteristics of the annular mode. In the presence of simultaneous fluctuations in jet strength and position, the leading zonal-mean geopotential EOF mode (strongly resembling the annular mode) is shown to mix the zonal index mode of zonal-mean zonal wind with other EOF modes, demonstrating why the annular mode and zonal index mode are related but distinct. The greater sensitivity to domain size of EOF modes of geopotential relative to the EOF modes of zonal-mean zonal wind is also discussed. This study focuses on the Southern Hemisphere summertime, which is characterized by a single, eddy-driven jet; the generality of the results presented suggest that the conclusions should be qualitatively unchanged in the presence of both subtropical and eddy-driven jets.},

The focus is on the southern annular mode (SAM), the nature of its recent trend, and the zonal symmetry of associated spatial patterns. The study uses the NCEP\textendash{}Department of Energy Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project II Reanalysis (NCEP-2) (period 1979\textendash{}2009) to obtain robust patterns over the recent years and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project (period 1871\textendash{}2008) to document decadal changes. Also presented is a comparison of these signals against a station-based reconstruction of the SAM index and a gridded interpolated dataset [Hadley Centre Sea Level Pressure dataset version 2 (HadSLP2)].Over their common period, both reanalyses are in fair agreement, both in terms of spatial patterns and temporal variability. In particular, both datasets show weather regimes that can be interpreted as the opposite phases of the SAM. At the decadal time scale, the study shows that the trend toward the positive SAM phase (as inferred from the usual EOF-based index) is related more to an increase in the frequency of clusters corresponding to the positive phase, with little changes in the frequency of the negative SAM events. Similarly, the long-term tropospheric warming trend already discussed in the literature is shown to be related more to a decrease in the number of abnormally cold days, with little changes in the number of abnormally warm days. The cluster analysis therefore allows for complement descriptions based on simple indexes or EOF decompositions, highlighting the nonlinear nature of the decadal changes in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation and temperature.},

Observational analyses show that the AM zonal patterns are more zonally asymmetric during days when the STJ downstream of the storm track is unusually strong, and vice versa. In the idealized model, the STJ downstream of the storm track is varied by introducing an additional zonally localized tropical heating. The model's AM variability exhibits a nearly zonally uniform structure when there is no or only weak tropical heating. However, the signatures of the AM are locally strengthened in the heating sector; thus, the AM zonal pattern is zonally asymmetric when the tropical heating is large enough to create a strong STJ. The model results also show that the percentage of the variance explained by the AM, the persistence of the AM index, and the intensity of eddy feedback are also increased when the tropical heating becomes stronger. It is argued herein that the zonal asymmetry of the AM pattern is caused by the zonal asymmetry of the anomalous synoptic eddy forcing projecting on the AM, which is primarily due to the zonal asymmetry of the variations of the storm track between the nonheating and heating sectors.},

  abstract = {Extratropical impacts on tropical climates are one of the most exciting areas of meteorological investigation in recent times. The present study elucidates the seasonal impact of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on predominant tropical circulations such as Hadley and Walker. The velocity potential at 200~hPa is used to understand the spatio-temporal variability in tropical circulations in the boreal summer and winter seasons. The results show an intensification of seasonal velocity potential in the composite of the low phase of the SAM. The seasonal climatological values of velocity potential observed for the period from 1979 to 2012 are of lesser magnitudes than earlier findings. The convergence/divergence locations of tropical circulation have shifted from their mean positions in the alternative phase of the SAM. The low-level convergence in the southern hemispheric Hadley circulation (HC) is enhanced in the composite of the positive phase of the SAM; however, the SAM's effect on the HC is no stronger in the summer. Another interesting feature noted in the present study is the weakening of the Walker circulation associated with the positive phase of the SAM, which can influence the basic state of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The SAM's interannual variability exhibits a significant positive trend in winter. The study reveals that the positive phase of the SAM could be a possible explanation for the recent changes in the tropical circulation patterns; however, the variability in tropical circulation anomalies associated with the SAM should be noted on seasonal and monthly scales to understand the dynamical mechanism behind the relationship. The impact of the SAM on tropical circulation may continue in future decades, as this southern extratropical vacillation is predicted to remain in a positive phase due to the increase in greenhouse gases and the variability in ozone.},

  abstract = {Fan (2007) recently documented the zonal asymmetry of the Antarctic oscillation (AAO) in the austral winter. In this research, the zonal asymmetry of the northern annular mode, or the Arctic oscillation (AO), in the interannual variability is studied for the boreal winter. It is shown that there is zonal asymmetry of the AO as well, similar to the case of the Antarctic oscillation (AAO). However, the zonal asymmetry of the AO is considerably weaker than that of the AAO. This is far beyond the speculation, since the zonal asymmetry of the geography is larger in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. The Western and Eastern Hemispheres portions of the AO are correlated at 0.54 for 1959\textendash{}1998, comparing with 0.23 for the case of the AAO. The authors also discussed the physical reason for this inter-hemispheric difference, and partly attributed it to the El Ni{\~n}o and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle which may be represented by the SO index. It is indicated that the SO associated sea-level pressure (SLP) patterns are more zonal symmetric in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Annular mode in the extratropical atmosphere, whether it is dynamically reasonable concept, is examined in the so\textendash{}called aquaplanet general circulation model. Standard analyses of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and one\textendash{}point correlation to the low\textendash{}frequency surface pressure anomaly yield results similar to previous studies: the dominant annular mode in EOF but more non\textendash{}annular distribution in the correlation maps, leading to a difficulty to argue whether the annular structure is a statistical artifact. Similar analyses to the upper\textendash{}tropospheric streamfunction are, however, able to successfully distinguish the annular mode from a slowly propagating, wavenumber-five (m = 5) disturbance, both of which are forced by high\textendash{}frequency eddies. Since the amplitude of the m = 5 waves is weakly interrelated to the annular mode, snapshots of the annular mode extreme tend to accompany large non\textendash{}annular components. In the aquaplanet experiment with zonally varying boundary condition involved, the annular mode in streamfunction becomes more prevailing, in which the low\textendash{}frequency eddy itself, in addition to the high\textendash{}frequency eddies, drives the zonal\textendash{}mean wind anomaly.},
